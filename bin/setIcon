# See http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?HowToSetACustomIconWithRez (sorry this is the link circa 2008)
# Ideas from "fromassigniconscript.20.hasseg@spamgourmet.com"
# Their work was presumably based on apple's developer code in 2007 (namely requiring "Rez").

# This implementation however is from after reading about the idea (including code) but is seperate
# and furthure is/was NOT endorced by "Ali Rantakari, 2007" however as a fellow computer scientist,
# this note here is included as a best effort nod (preverbial) to those who came before in the
